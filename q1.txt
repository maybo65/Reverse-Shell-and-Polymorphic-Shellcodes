the buffer that going to hold the message is from size 1024. so, we are going to pad our message with 1000 chars of x\11. after that padding, we are going to add our malicious input, by adding to that AAABBBBCCCC...ZZZZ (A till Z four time each letter). meaning, that we are sending to the server a message with the payload \x00\x00\x04\x51\x11\x11....\x11\AAABBBBCCCC...ZZZZ. the first four bytes are indicating the leangth of the message (including the null terminator), and some big enougth input that is going to make the server crash because of a buffer overflow.
